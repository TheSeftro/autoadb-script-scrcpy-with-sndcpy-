# Autoadb script (scrcpy & sndcpy)
This is an example script for [autoadb](https://github.com/rom1v/autoadb), [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) and [sndcpy](sndcpy).
<br />
The script, as sugested by the programs it uses, automatically launches scrcpy and sndcpy for the devices you connect
## Setup and usage
Just download and extract into the same folder (for sndcpy, select the version without adb if avariable because scrcpy already comes with it)
and run autoadb.bat.
<br /> This script currently fits my needs, make it fit yours!
